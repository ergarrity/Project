# At Home in Oregon

At Home In Oregon is a data visualization tool designed to help social services and education professionals in the state of Oregon gain insight into trends in student and family homelessness. This web application provides users with an interactive map to view and compare Oregon Department of Education student homelessness statistics, offering an array of visualizations for each county that highlights local trends in the data. This focus on statistics at the local level provides users with valuable insight around an affordable housing crisis with often hyper-local nuances.

## The Tool

When the page loads, users are presented with a large display of a map of the state of Oregon and invited to click marker icons throughout the map to explore the data for each county. Below the map, four charts display selected views of the data to highlight different aspects of trends in the statistics.

A user can hover over an individual marker to see the name of the county the marker represents, and clicking the a marker opens an info window with a stacked bar chart dispalying K-12 student homelessness statistics for that county by year. Public school students who are homeless are classified in one of four ways, and the bars are stacked according to these classifications:

1. Living in a motel temporarily.
2. Sharing housing with another family or multiple families (commonly referred to as "doubled up").
3. Living in a family homeless shelter.
4. Unsheltered--living in a tent, vehicle, sleeping on the streets, or living in some other structure unsuitable for use as housing.
